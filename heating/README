159735 Assignment 3 startup package
-----------------------------------

Do not modify array.hxx, arrayff.hxx, fits.hxx, fitsfile.h, or fitsfile.cpp.

1 - First make sure you have the cfitsio library and ds9 installed on your 
system

2 - The build the start up package as follows:

Save the file heating.tar to somewhere in your home directory

Unpack the file:

tar xvf heating.tar

You will then see the directory heating/ You can rename it if you like.

Change to that directory and open the makefile in a text editor. Make the 
necessary modifications to the makefile.

Build the demo program:

make heat_demo

Run the demo program with the image dimensions as a user argument, eg:

./heat_demo 100

This will create a 100X100 pixel image called "plate0.fit". You can view 
this image using ds9:

ds9 plate0.fit &

This is just the initial state of the image before running the heat transfer 
solution. You need to modify this to implement heat transfer as discussed in 
the lectures. It is suggested you copy heat_demo.cpp to another source program 
and work on that. You will then need to make another entry in the makefile.
