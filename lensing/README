159735 Assignment 4 startup package
-----------------------------------

This contains utilities similar to those used in Assignment 3. Do not modify 
array.hxx, arrayff.hxx, fits.hxx, fitsfile.h, fitsfile.cpp, lenses.h, or 
lenses.cpp.

1 - First make sure you have the cfitsio library and ds9 installed on your 
system (as you did with Assignment 3)

2 - Then build the start up package as follows:

Save the file lensing.tar to somewhere in your home directory

Unpack the file:

      tar xvf lensing.tar

You will then see the directory lensing/ You can rename it if you like.

Change to that directory and open the makefile in a text editor. Make the 
necessary modifications to the makefile.

Build the demo program:

      make lens_demo

Run the demo program:

      ./lens_demo

This will create an image called "lens.fit". You can view this image using ds9:

      ds9 lens.fit &

However, this will just show us a blank image. You need to complete this 
program by implementing the lens equation.
